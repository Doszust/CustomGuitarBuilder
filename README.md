# CustomGuitarBuilder
A CRUD Application to create guitars for customers.

TO VIEW JAVA CODE:
GuitarApplication/src/GuitarApp

Works With Oracle SQL*Plus 11c express.

TO USE

Download Oracle Database 

I used 11c express edition, available for free at:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/downloads/index.html

Create a user with admin options
run Custom_Guitar_Database_Build.sql to build the database.
Make sure the ojdbc7.jar is added to the project
Run the project and login with your oracle user login (It will be sent to your database to login and access it).

For more detailed information on setting up the database read OracleDatabaseSetup in the ProjectSetup Folder.
